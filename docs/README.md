# University of Warsaw Lagrangian Cloud Model (UWLCM)

üå¶Ô∏è Welcome to the UWLCM documentation. This is a work in progress.

UWLCM is a sophisticated numerical modeling tool for cloud simulation that combines Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modeling with Lagrangian cloud microphysics. The model is designed for high-fidelity atmospheric cloud modeling and research applications.

## Overview

UWLCM provides a comprehensive framework for simulating cloud dynamics and microphysics using advanced numerical methods. The model integrates atmospheric turbulence modeling with detailed cloud microphysics, enabling researchers to study cloud formation, evolution, and precipitation processes.

## Key Features

- **MPDATA Algorithm**: Advanced finite-difference scheme for accurate advection calculations
- **Different microphysics schemes**:
    - Superdroplet Method for detailed particle-level simulations
    - Bulk microphysics for computational efficiency
- **Turbulence Modeling**:
    - Smagorinsky scheme for explicit SGS modeling
    - Implicit LES for computational efficiency
- **Flexible Dimensionality**: Support for both 2D and 3D simulations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Superdroplet microphysics can utilize GPU computing for enhanced performance



## Dependencies

UWLCM is built upon two key libraries:

- **[libmpdata++](https://github.com/igfuw/libmpdataxx)**: Advanced advection library implementing the MPDATA algorithm
- **[libcloudph++](https://github.com/igfuw/libcloudphxx)**: Comprehensive cloud microphysics library
